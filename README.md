# Mexico City Air Quality Prediction System üåç
> Citizens with accurate air quality forecasts and personalized health recommendations

## Project Overview
This repository contains the deployment phase of our Mexico City Air Quality Prediction System, focusing on the Streamlit application development. Our goal is to provide accurate 24-hour air quality forecasts while making the information accessible and actionable for all citizens.

## üéØ Key Objectives
- Achieve 85% accuracy in 24-hour forecasts for major pollutants
- Serve 90% of Mexico City's neighbourhoods
- Support multiple languages (Spanish, English, and Indigenous languages)
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Handle real-time data from 30+ monitoring stations

## üöÄ Current Phase: Streamlit Deployment
We are currently focusing on building a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit. This phase includes:

- [ ] Basic dashboard setup
- [ ] Forecast display system
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Personalized recommendations
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] Multi-language support

## üíª Tech Stack
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly/Matplotlib
- FastAPI (API integration)

## ü§ù How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository ()
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)

## Activating the Application (Locally)
This section details how any newbie Python user can debug or preview the Streamlit application from their local repository.

1. Ensure that you have set-up and are currently accessing a `virtual environment` in your local repo. You may refer to the **Installation Steps** listed above this.
2. From the Terminal, where the current working directory is the root folder, type `streamlit run Main_dashboard/Main_landing_page_custom.py`. This will initialize the Streamlit application locally.
3. To close the application fully, you may Press `CTRL+C` from the terminal to close the application.

### Priority Areas for Contribution
